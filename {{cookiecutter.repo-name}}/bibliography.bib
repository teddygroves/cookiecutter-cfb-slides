  abstract = {Enzyme turnover numbers (kcat values) are key parameters to understand cell metabolism, proteome allocation and physiological diversity, but experimentally measured kcat data are sparse and noisy. Here we provide a deep learning approach to predict kcat values for metabolic enzymes in a high-throughput manner with the input of substrate structures and protein sequences. Our approach can capture kcat changes for mutated enzymes and identify amino acid residues with great impact on kcat values. Furthermore, we applied the approach to predict genome scale kcat values for over 300 yeast species, demonstrating that the predicted kcat values are consistent with current evolutional understanding. Additionally, we designed an automatic pipeline using the predicted kcat values to parameterize enzyme-constrained genome scale metabolic models (ecGEMs) facilitated by a Bayesian approach, which outperformed the default ecGEMs in predicting phenotypes and proteomes and enabled to explain phenotype differences among yeast species. The deep learning kcat prediction approach and automatic ecGEM construction pipeline would thus be a valuable tool to uncover the global trend of enzyme kinetics and physiological diversity, and to further elucidate cell metabolism on a large scale.},

  abstract = {The Michaelis constant KM describes the affinity of an enzyme for a specific substrate and is a central parameter in studies of enzyme kinetics and cellular physiology. As measurements of KM are often difficult and time-consuming, experimental estimates exist for only a minority of enzyme-substrate combinations even in model organisms. Here, we build and train an organism-independent model that successfully predicts KM values for natural enzyme-substrate combinations using machine and deep learning methods. Predictions are based on a task-specific molecular fingerprint of the substrate, generated using a graph neural network, and on a deep numerical representation of the enzyme's amino acid sequence. We provide genome-scale KM predictions for 47 model organisms, which can be used to approximately relate metabolite concentrations to cellular physiology and to aid in the parameterization of kinetic models of cellular metabolism.},
